summary: Update commit status for GitHub repositories.
description: |- 
  This Step updates the commit status for a GitHub repository (repo) of your choice with this build's status. Useful anytime you can not or do not want to provide Bitrise write access to your git repo.
  
  ### Configuring the Step
  
  1. In the **Authorization token for GitHub applications** Step input, you need to provide a token you generated on [GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens), with `repo/repo:status` scope.
  2. The **Repository URL** input is populated automatically with a variable the value of which is taken from the repository field of the Settings of your app.
  3. The **Commit hash** input is filled in by default with the variable inherited from the **Git Clone** Step.
  4. The **Build URL** Step input is also filled in automatically, this is the URL that is forwarded to GitHub as the source of the status.
  5. The **GitHub API base URL** is the URL for GitHub's API service, has to be modified if you are running an Enterprise GitHub instance.
  6. With the **Status Identifier** Step input, you can adjust under what name which CI status shows up.
  7. The input **Set Specific Status** has a default value of `auto` which reflects the status of the build, but this input allows you to update the commit with any given status, regardless of the outcome of the build.
  8. The **Description** input allows you to provide a short description for the status. 
  9. **Verbose logging** can be turned on to print out additional information within the build logs. 

  ### Troubleshooting
  
  If you get a 404 response when running the Step, check your token's scope and validity.
  If you use GitHub Enterprise, make sure your API base URL is set to `http(s)://hostname/api/v3/`.
  If you do not see your status being reflected, double-check **Repository URL** and **Commit hash** input values.
